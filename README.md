## Building
See the [build instructions page](https://robotleopard86.github.io/CacaoEngine/latest/manual/building.html) for information.

## Documentation
Documentation is built and deployed automatically to https://robotleopard86.github.io/CacaoEngine.  
If you want to build it yourself, everything is located in the `docs` folder. See the [docs build instructions page](docs/README.md) for more information.

## Branching Scheme
Cacao Engine uses two branches, `main` and `dev`. `main` should be considered stable and should **NEVER** be pushed to on its own. `dev` is where main work can happen and is allowed to be unstable and break. Only once `dev` is in a stable state can it be merged into `main` via a pull request.

## Licensing
Cacao Engine is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, which can be found in the root directory. All third-party licenses are present in the `licenses` folder.
Any third-party code used by these libraries should have their licenses located within the appropriate project directory (these may not be downloaded until build-time by Meson).
Additionally, the file `expf.c`, located in the `cacao` directory, is designated entirely to the public domain to the extent applicable by law. This is because it's a stupid tiny patch that only exists because of weirdness with the Linux math library that I have encountered, and frankly don't care about.
