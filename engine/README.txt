Most of the code contained here (for now) has simply been moved over from the OLD_CODE folder in the root, which, as its README says, will soon be deleted.

This code will be undergoing active maintennance, updates, and potentially large changes.

Do not expect anything in this folder to remain consistent until this notice is removed.

In general, old stuff will be kept in a folder named OLD_(whatever), but again, do not expect anything there to remain consistent, as much will be moved around.
