# Exception Codes

Cacao Engine exceptions rely on a code system to give further context about the exception. Engine core codes are a one or two-digit number. Backend codes are three digits, beginning with `1` and followed by a two-digit number, prefixed with a `0` if less than ten (example: `104`). All codes registered by your game should follow a similar format, but beginning with any other number than `1` or `0`.
