# Build Instructions

```{topic} This page is **up-to-date**! 
The information on this page pertains to the engine post-restructuring.
```

These instructions will guide you through the process of building Cacao Engine.  
```{warning}
Before you begin, please check the [Platform Support page](./platforms) to ensure you have a compatible system!
```

## Prerequisites
* Git
* Meson
* Ninja
* Python 3
* CMake

<details>
<summary><b><i>Platform-specific System Dependencies</i></b></summary>
<hr/>

#### Windows
Install the Windows SDK via [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com) or [direct download](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/downloads/windows-sdk).

#### macOS
Install [Xcode](https://developer.apple.com/xcode) or the Command Line Tools for Developers (run `xcode-select --install` in your terminal to install) to get the macOS SDK.

#### Fedora Linux and derivatives (e.g. RHEL, Nobara):
Run the following command to install all necessary system packages (you may need `sudo` privileges):
`dnf install wayland-devel wayland-protocols-devel libxkbcommon-devel libxcb-devel xcb-util-devel xcb-util-wm-devel xcb-util-keysyms-devel libdrm-devel libuuid-devel pipewire-devel pulseaudio-libs-devel alsa-lib alsa-lib-devel`

#### Debian GNU/Linux and derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu, Mint, Pop!_OS):
Run the following command to install all necessary system packages (you may need `sudo` privileges):
`apt install libwayland-dev wayland-protocols libxkbcommon-dev xorg-dev libxcb1-dev libxcb-icccm4-dev libxcb-keysyms1-dev libxcb-randr0-dev libxcb-util-dev libxcb-xkb-dev libdrm-dev uuid-dev libpipewire-0.3-dev libpulse-dev libasound2-dev`

#### Arch Linux and derivatives (e.g. Manjaro, Garuda, EndeavourOS):
Run the following command to install all necessary system packages (you may need `sudo` privileges):
`pacman -S libglvnd mesa libxkbcommon wayland-protocols libxcb xcb-util xcb-util-keysyms xcb-util-wm util-linux-libs libdrm libpipewire libpulse alsa-lib`

#### Linux Notes
You may be able to use a subset of the listed packages by disabling some features. For example, the Wayland-related packages are not needed if only building for X11, and the XCB packages are not needed if only building for Wayland (though `libxkbcommon` is mandatory). Similarly, you may not need Pipewire packages or ALSA packages if not targeting those audio subsystems, though it is recommended to always include them for best compatibility.

## Compiler Support
Cacao Engine is primarily built and tested using [Clang](https://clang.llvm.org) with the [LLD linker](https://lld.llvm.org). While it should compile using GCC or MSVC or alternate linkers, no compatibility guarantees are assured. Cacao Engine is currently confirmed to build correctly on Windows, macOS, and Fedora Linux using Clang and LLD. More compatibility tests will be conducted prior to release.  

A note about Apple Clang: In recent versions of macOS, the `libc++` headers have been updated such that different compiler flags are necessary, but Meson does not apply the correct flags unless it detects Clang version `18.x` or newer. However, the default version shipped is `17.0.0`, so the outdated flags are used and the build will fail. There is an active issue to fix this, but in the meantime, please install Clang and LLD via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) to install the latest versions (`brew install llvm lld`).

## Build
In the root Cacao Engine directory, run the following command to configure the build: `meson setup <build directory> --native-file native.ini -Dbackends=<graphics backends>`. The available backends are `opengl` and `vulkan`. See the [backends info page](./backends) for more details. 

You can also choose to build the sandbox application by adding `-Dbuild_sandbox=true` to the command line.  

On Linux, the supported windowing systems can be selected via the `linux_windowing` option. By default, this is set to `x11,wayland` to include both, but you can choose to exclude one if you wish.

Windows builds also have the option of disabling the automatic console window by setting `-Dwindows_noconsole=true` on the command line.

For a complete list of options, please see the file `meson_options.txt` in the root directory.  

Please note that configuration may take a long time, especially in a fresh checkout of the repository, since all non-system dependencies will be downloaded at this time (some of which are large).  

Once configuration is complete, run `meson compile -C <build directory>` to build the engine. Like configuration, this will take a while, as the dependencies contribute a few thousand objects (mostly from LLVM in the reflection generator). If you chose to build the sandbox application, it can be found in the `sandbox` directory in your build directory. On Windows, it will not run out of the box due to not being able to find DLLs. When using Wayland, window decorations may fail to load due to the same issue. For this reason, it is advised to first run `meson devenv` in your build directory to set up the proper paths.

## Visual Studio
Cacao Engine has not yet been tested with Meson's Visual Studio backend. It is not guaranteed to work, but feel free to try it out for yourself. Official guidance will be provided closer to release when testing begins.
