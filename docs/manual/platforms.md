# Platform Support

```{topic} This page is **up-to-date**! 
The information on this page pertains to the engine post-restructuring.
```

## Supported OSes and Architectures
* x86_64 Windows
* aarch64 macOS
* x86_64/aarch64 GNU/Linux (most distros)

## Currently Supported GNU/Linux Distros
Not every GNU/Linux distro is supported, but most are:
* Debian and derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS)
* Fedora and derivatives (e.g. Nobara)
* Arch and derivatives (e.g. EndeavourOS, Garuda, Manjaro) 

SteamOS will be supported for playing games, but developing on SteamOS is not likely to be ever supported.  

Support for openSUSE is planned and will come in the future.

More operating systems/platforms may be supported in the future, though this is not guaranteed.

## Versions
Cacao Engine aims to support computers running any OS version listed below or a later version, but older systems may be dropped over time.  
* Windows 11 (all versions) and later
* macOS Ventura (13.x) and later
* Debian 12 and later, plus derivatives
    * Ubuntu 22.04 and later, plus derivatives, while based on Debian 11, have supplementary packages that work
* Fedora 37 and later, plus derivatives
* As Arch and derivatives are based on rolling releases, there are no defined versions. Cacao Engine should work on a package set from the start of 2024 or later, but for best compatibility, always target the latest packages

If any issues are encountered in these versions, they should be supported to the extent that it is possible. Any issues in versions before these are **not supported**.  

## Notes
Cacao Engine is a very small project; as such it is impossible to guarantee support for specific versions of operating systems. Generally, most up-to-date systems should work and be supported, but this is not a hard rule. Typically, minor releases of an operating system will be supported as long as their respective major version is (for example, macOS 15.1 should be supported as long any 15.x release is), but this is not guaranteed, especially if said minor release introduces major changes.
**In general, most up-to-date systems should be supported.**
