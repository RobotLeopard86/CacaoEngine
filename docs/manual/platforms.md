# Platform Support

## Supported OSes and Architectures
* x86_64 Windows
* aarch64 macOS (Apple Silicon)
* x86_64/aarch64 GNU/Linux (most distros)

## Currently Supported GNU/Linux Distros
Not every GNU/LINUX distro is supported, but most are:
* Debian and derivatives (e.g. Ubuntu, Linux Mint, Pop!_OS)
* Fedora and derivatives (e.g. Nobara)
* Arch and derivatives (e.g. EndeavourOS, Garuda, Manjaro) 

SteamOS will be supported for playing games, but developing on SteamOS is not likely to be ever supported.  

Support for openSUSE is planned and will come in the future.

More operating systems/platforms may be supported in the future, though this is not guaranteed.

## System Versioning Notes
Cacao Engine is a very small project; as such it is impossible to guarantee support for specific versions of operating systems. Generally, most up-to-date systems should work and be supported, but this is not a hard rule. Typically, minor releases of an operating system will be supported as long as their respective major version is (for example, macOS 15.1 should be supported as long any 15.x release is), but this is not guaranteed.  
**In general, nost up-to-date systems should be supported.**
